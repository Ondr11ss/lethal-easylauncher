## ⚙️ Configurable Settings

*Default settings are generally great for most scenarios. Check out the comments in the code for more insights. 🔍 The configuration settings are now located in the `config.py` file!<br>
**CAPS_LOCK is the default for flipping the switch on the autoaim superpower! ⚙️ 🎯**

`useMask` - Set to `True` or `False` to turn on and off 🎭

`maskWidth` - The width of the mask to use. Only used when `useMask` is `True` 📐

`maskHeight` - The height of the mask to use. Only used when `useMask` is `True` 📐

`aaQuitKey` - The go-to key is `q`, but if it clashes with your game style, swap it out! ⌨️♻️

`headshot_mode` - Set to `False` if you're aiming to keep things less head-on and more centered. 🎯➡️👕

`cpsDisplay` - Toggle off with `False` if you prefer not to display the CPS in your command station. 💻🚫

`visuals` - Flip to `True` to witness the AI's vision! Great for sleuthing out any hiccups. 🕵️‍♂️✅

`aaMovementAmp` - The preset should be on point for 99% of players. Lower the digits for smoother targeting. Recommended doses: `0.5` - `2`. ⚖️🕹️

`confidence` - Stick with the script here unless you're the expert. 🧐✨

`screenShotHeight` - Same as above, no need for changes unless you've got a specific vision. 📏🖼️

`screenShotWidth` - Keep it constant as is, unless you've got reasons to adjust. 📐🖼️

`aaDetectionBox` - Default's your best bet, change only if you've got the know-how. 📦✅

`onnxChoice` - Gear up for the right graphics card—Nvidia, AMD, or CPU power! 💻👾

`centerOfScreen` - Keep this switched on to stay in the game's heart. ❤️🖥️
